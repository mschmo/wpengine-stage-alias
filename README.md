Script to allow local access to WPEngine staging domain under correct domain alias.
Good for previewing changes to sites with 3rd party services like Adsense.

Requires [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Will install it for you if it's not found.

Usage
-----

Run `./staging.sh [site_domains]` to launch.
```
$ ./staging.sh example another
Staging servers started. Access at:
staging.example.com
staging.another.com
```
